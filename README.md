# Building Permits in Calgary - Geoweb Application

## Overview
This web mapping application allows users to visualize and filter building permits in Calgary. The application fetches data from the City of Calgaryâ€™s Open Data Portal and displays building permits on an interactive Leaflet.js map.

## Features

  - Issued Date
  - Work Class Group
  - Contractor Name
  - Community Name
  - Original Address
- **Overlapping Marker Handling**: Uses OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier to manage markers at the same location.
- **Marker Clustering**: Uses Leaflet.markercluster to improve visualization when markers are densely packed.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The map refreshes when a new date range is selected, displaying only the relevant results.
